# Guia-CSS

this is the first page i've done while studying for css style tools

CSS is a tool for optimize the style of your website. As we can see in the style.css, file we need to put some attributes for each sector that we call in our html file

for example

We have a tag called h1, which means the first heading tag, in this css file, we put an "{}" in front of this element to put the attributes inside of it, theres a lot of attributes we can put in each tag of our html file and the css will help us to style this elements. 
    
    h1{
      text-align: center;
      font-size: 60px;
      }

In another example we have the "*" tag that we can put some attributes too, this "*" tag is a tag for the all page, would be very usefull to put the "font-family" on this tag because the all page is using the same font.

    *{
      font-size: 10px; /* px significa "pixels": o tamanho da fonte base é agora de 10 pixels */ 
      font-family: "Open Sans", sans-serif; /* este deve ser o nome da fonte que você obteve no Google Fonts */ 
     }
